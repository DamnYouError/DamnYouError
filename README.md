# 👋 Hi, I'm Error known as Nemesis

I am a **low-level systems and security developer** specializing in **game anti-cheat**, **kernel-mode security**, and **anti-tamper research**.  
My work focuses on detecting advanced manipulation techniques across **usermode, kernelmode, and virtualized environments**.

## 🛡️ Core Specialization

- 🎮 Game Anti-Cheat & Anti-Tamper Systems
- 🧠 Windows Kernel Security (WDK)
- 🧵 Stack & Execution Integrity (APC / DPC / NMI)
- 🧬 Memory & Image Integrity Enforcement
- 🖥️ Hypervisor & EPT Hook Detection
- 🔍 Anti-Debugging & Anti-VM Research
